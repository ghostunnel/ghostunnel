ZeroSSL API client [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/caddyserver/zerossl.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/caddyserver/zerossl)
==================

This package implements the [ZeroSSL REST API](https://zerossl.com/documentation/api/) in Go.

The REST API is distinct from the [ACME endpoint](https://zerossl.com/documentation/acme/), which is a standardized way of obtaining certificates.
